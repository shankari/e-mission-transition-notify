This file lists the library dependencies for this plugin and their licenses.

1. These libraries are downloaded automatically and linked to the final binary.
I am not sure how android or iOS link their binaries. However, the xcode link
command uses `-llibname` extensively, so I assume static linkage in general.

1. So our primary check here is for libraries which do not have a license, or
which are GPL licensed.

# Native libraries installed via maven/cocoapods

This plugin does not depend on any external libraries
